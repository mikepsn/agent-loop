# agent-loop

Slides describing alternative ways to rethink about the intelligent agent
perceive-reason-act loop. 

These slides were developed in the early days of undertaking my PhD and were
originally just put together to explore some ideas but ended up turning into
the initial ideas for substantial part of my research (even though the ideas
presented in slides are in a very rough and preliminary form).

The slides introduce some important concepts:

* The idea that the traditional sense-reason-act agent loop needs to change.
* The current agent-environment interaction model isn't very situated.
* How to incorporate feedback loops into the agent reasoning loop.
* Incorporating mental state as a feedback mechanism into environmental perception. 
* Introducing the idea of direct perception from ecological psychology.
* Incorporating the idea of affordances into intelligent agents.

The slides were originally in PPT format, but I converted them to beamer format
using the 16:10 aspect ration (widescreen). Apart from some minor updates the
pseudcode (using the algorithmicx package for example) and updates for LaTeX
the slides remained unchanged to the ones I presented to my doctoral advisors
in October 2002.
